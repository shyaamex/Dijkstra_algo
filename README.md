This is a mini project in python, which demonstrate the working of Dijkstra Algorithm using visualization. 

**Dijkstra algorithm** is a single-source shortest path algorithm. Here, single-source means that only one 
source is given, and we have to find the shortest path from the source to all the nodes.
